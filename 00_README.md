# Python-journey-

This is my journey to learning Python as well as GitHub. 
I have always had difficulty learning codeing languages of any kind. 
I found that I retain information alot better if I write out what im learning in my own words and in a way that make sense to me.  

I welcome any critisizm of what I have written or help if I may have written something incorrectly. There is always a better way. 

I am going to add each lesson as its own .py in the file tree with their own comments and combine what I think belongs together
as it becomes more complex and bloated. 

I am sure there will be alot of unnecessary files I will have to re-organize as I get more proficient with GitHub and Python. 


Connecting visual studio to my GitHub. 

Using Visual Studio code is easy for me to use as it provides alot of extensions and organization. 

After a quick google search the fastest way I found to connect my GitHub to my Visual Studio was to follow these instructions 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=create-repo-command-palette%2Cinitialize-repo-activity-bar%2Ccreate-branch-command-palette%2Ccommit-changes-command-palette%2Cpush-command-palette

There has to be a better way to make links shorter, I will have to look it up later. 


Some of the extensions i have installed in Visual Studio are:
pylance, 
python, 
python enviornment manager, 
python extension pack and 
python indent.
