# Variables are containers that hold informaiton,  you can assign
# numbers or intigers as well as strings to a variable.
# then call the variable instead of re-typing the same thing over
# and over again.  

first_string_var = "Hello, World!"
first_integer_var = 2

# When you add a string to a variable then make sure you use qoutes.
# intigers and nubmers do not need qoutes. use the print() to call 
# the varable to the terminal. 

print(first_integer_var)
print(first_integer_var)
