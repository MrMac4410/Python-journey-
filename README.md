# Python-journey-

This is my journey to learning Python as well as GitHub. 
I have always had difficulty learning codeing languages of any kind. 
I found that I retain information alot better if I write out what im learning in my own words and in a way that make sense to me.  
I welcome any critisizm of what I have written or help if I may have written something incorrectly. 

I am going to add each lesson as its own .py in the file tree with their own comments and combine what I think belongs together as 
its becomes more complex and bloated. I am sure there will be alot of unnecessary files I will have to re-organize as I get more
proficient with GitHub and Python.
