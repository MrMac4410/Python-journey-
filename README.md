# Python-journey-

This is my journey to learning Python as well as GitHub.  I have always had difficulty learning codeing languages of any kind, but found that I retain information alot better if I write out what im learning in my own words and in a way that make sense to me.  I welcome any critisizm of what I have written or help if I may have written something incorrectly.
