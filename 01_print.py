# Sending information to the terminal is one of the first things you will learn in any codeing language.
# the iconic "Hello, World!" is always the first thing you do. The method used in python to send this
# information to your terminal is print() 

print("Hello, World!")

# Hello, World! is considered a string, a string is a sequence of characters "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". When you add a string you should
# always put it in Double "" or single '' qoutes.   Double qoutes are more commenly used in python, as it simplifies some of the issues
# you can have when you need to use a apostrophe in a sentence. "There, Their and They're".  if you use sing qoutes 'There, Their, and They're'.
# it would assume the string ended at 'There, Their, and they'.   The use of double or single qoutes is interchangable,  but should be consistent throughout
# your codeing.
