# Sending information to the terminal is one of the first things you will learn
# in any coding language. The iconic "Hello, World!" is always one of first things
# you do. The method used in python to send this information to your terminal is print() 

print("Hello, World!")

# Hello, World! is considered a string, a string is a sequence of characters
# "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". When you add a string you should always put it 
# in Double "" or single '' quotes. Double quotes are more commonly used in 
# python, as it simplifies some of the issues you can have when you need to 
# use a apostrophe in a sentence. "There, Their and They're". 

# print('There, Their, They're')
      
# if you use single quotes 'There, Their, and They're'. it would assume the 
# string ended at 'There, Their, and they'. and throw and error stating
# 're' was not closed or was missing a single quote mark '. You could use triple quotes
# if you really want to use the single quote.  

print('''There, Their, They're''') 

# But from what ive read so far I believe this to me a mis-use of the triple quotes and
# does not follow standard coding guidance.  

# it would be simpler in my opinion to use double quotes "".

print("There, Their, They're")


# The use of double or single quotes is interchangeable, 
# but should be consistent throughout your codein.
